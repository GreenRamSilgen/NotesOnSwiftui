# Useful Paths

USE FINDER then CMD + SHIFT + G 
This will bring up an input box for the paths.

**Devices**
~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/
Actual simulators on xcode. Deleting these will mean you need to manually create new simulators



**Derived Data**
~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
Each project has its own so you need to find the one you want to delete and remove it.

## Key points

- Each path holds some data for some specific part of the app.
